I am a Dutch PhD candidate at Utrecht University, supervised by [Gunther Cornelissen](https://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~corne102/) and [Don Bernard Zagier](https://people.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/zagier/). 

I'm interested in modular forms and algebraic combinatorics. The title of my thesis project is _Examples, reformulations and generalisations of the Bloch-Okounkov theorem_.
