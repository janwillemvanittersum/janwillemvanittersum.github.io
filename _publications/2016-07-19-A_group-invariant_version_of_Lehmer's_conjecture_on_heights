excerpt: 'We state and prove a group-invariant version of Lehmer's conjecture on heights, generalizing papers by Zagier (1993) and Dresden (1998) which are special cases of this theorem. We also extend their three cases to a full classification of all finite cyclic groups satisfying the condition that the set of all orbits for which every non-zero element lies on the unit circle is finite and non-empty..'
